# image-sprite-webpack-plugin

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/image-sprite-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-sprite-webpack-plugin)

> A webpack plugin that generates spritesheets from your stylesheets.
 
## Input

* `width`, `height` and `background` properties are mandatory to create a sprite.
* [Shorthand properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) are recommended.

```css
h1.logo {
    width: 240px;
    height: 80px;
    background: url(./img/logo.png) no-repeat 0 0;
    font-size: 0;
}

span.itemPicture {
    display: inline-block;
    background-image: url(./img/item-picture.png);
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: 0 0;
    width: 36px;
    height: 36px;
}
```

## Output

```css
h1.logo {
  width: 240px;
  height: 80px;
  background: url(/css/sprite.png) no-repeat 0 -20px;
  /* background: url(/img/logo.png) no-repeat 0 0 */
  font-size: 0;
}

span.itemPicture {
  display: inline-block;
  background-image: url(/css/sprite.png);
  /* background-image: url(/img/item-picture.png) */
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: -100px -90px;
  /* background-position: 0 0 */
  width: 36px;
  height: 36px;
}
```

## Install

```bash
npm install -D image-sprite-webpack-plugin
```

## Example

### Production build

```js
const ImageSpritePlugin = require('image-sprite-webpack-plugin');

new ImageSpritePlugin({
    commentOrigin: false,
    compress: true,
    extensions: ['gif', 'png'],
    indent: '',
    log: true,
    //outputPath: './public',
    outputFilename: 'css/sprite-[hash].png',
    padding: 10,
    suffix: '' + Date.now() // do not need to use it with a outputFilename's [hash].
})
```

```bash
git clone this repository
cd examples/webpack4-cssloader-single-chunk
npm i
npm run build
```

### Webpack dev server

```js
const ImageSpritePlugin = require('image-sprite-webpack-plugin');

new ImageSpritePlugin({
    commentOrigin: true,
    compress: false,
    extensions: ['gif', 'png'],
    indent: '  ',
    log: true,
    //outputPath: './public',
    outputFilename: 'css/sprite.png',
    padding: 10,
    suffix: ''
})
```

```bash
git clone this repository
cd examples/webpack4-cssloader-single-chunk
npm i
npm start
```

## More Examples

* [webpack4 + css-loader](https://github.com/naver/image-sprite-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/webpack4-cssloader-single-chunk) (Supports Hot Module Reload)
* [webpack4 + css-loader + extract-text4.x(beta) + single chunk](https://github.com/naver/image-sprite-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/webpack4-extract-text-single-chunk) (Works, but not recommended.)
* [webpack4 + css-loader + mini-css-extract + multiple chunks](https://github.com/naver/image-sprite-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/webpack4-mini-css-extract-multiple-chunks) (with webpack4, this option is recommended.)
* [webpack4 + css-loader + mini-css-extract + multiple chunks + svg](https://github.com/naver/image-sprite-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/webpack4-mini-css-extract-multiple-chunks-svg) (svgs are not supported yet.)

## NPM Commands in Examples

Each example has the following command.

* Creates a production build.

	```bash
	npm run build
	```

* Starts webpack-dev-server

	```bash
	npm start
	```

* Creates a production build with node inspector. (with chrome://inspect/#devices)

	```bash
	npm run build-debug
	```

* Starts webpack-dev-server with node inspector. (with chrome://inspect/#devices)

	```bash
	npm run start-debug
	```

## Dependency

* This plugin requires [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) to handle CssModule.
* It is also recommended that you use a [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/file-loader) to automatically move and access image resource files.

## Compatibility

* Tested with webpack4
* Works fine with [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) on webpack4 (See [example](https://github.com/naver/image-sprite-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/webpack4-mini-css-extract-multiple-chunks))
* Works with [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin)
	* Works with webpack4 + extract-text-webpack-plugin 4.x
* As you would know, [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/extract-text-webpack-plugin) and [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) do not support HMR not yet. So using with these plugins is recommended on a production env.
